The Kubeflow Community is excited to announce the availability of the Kubeflow v1.6 software release, which includes
 support for Kubernetes v1.22 and introduces alpha of Kubeflow Pipeline v2 (KFP v2) functionality. 

Kubeflow v1.6 also adds new hyperparameter support for the population based algorithm in Katib, and provides a combined
 Python SDK for PyTorch, MXNet, MPI, XGBoost in Kubeflow’s distributed Training Operator. For model serving, v1.6 has
 new ClusterServingRuntime and ServingRuntime CRDs, and a new Model Spec was introduced to the InferenceService
 Predictor Spec, which provides a new way to specify models in KServe 0.8. Additionally, 1.6 cleans up a few CVEs in
 the central dashboard and enables PodDefaults webhook to pick new certificates. In Notebooks, 1.6 adds the ability to
 show objects from all namespaces and create a separate workflow for each notebook server. The Manifest Working Group
 developed and tested each Kubeflow’s component manifest for Kubernetes 1.22, coupled with the manifests that can be
 applied, the Pods of components that can become ready, and the basic objects that can be created.
 
In parallel to developing these new software features, the Kubeflow Community also completed its annual user survey.
 The survey generated many good user insights into requirements for Kubeflow, and you can see more on the
 [survey results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TLl8iFWQ-x2pVAHV9G8GFYMgAOuN2VFOnZV2JQNA-uc/edit#). Of the many
 highlights, we would like to identify the growing request for model monitoring as shown in the chart below.

We believe the increased focus on monitoring identifies Kubeflow’s maturing user base. The Community is making efforts
 to explain Kubeflow’s current functionality and build into the users’ new monitoring requirements. In addition,
 the user survey results and Kubeflow Working Group roadmaps will be discussed in the upcoming Kubeflow Summit. You can
 learn more about the Kubeflow Summit [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fLg1EqVtJekcXxT8GM_Rqg0-G-vIDVCrzuxE06Oq9dI/edit).

To round back to the current software delivery, the following takes a deeper look at the 1.6 highlights in more detail.

## Kubeflow v1.6 details

From a new feature introduction standpoint, Kubeflow v1.6 includes an experimental release of the KFP v2’s new front-end,
 back-end and SDK, which deliver a modern UI and DAG, first class support for metadata, and a simplified component
 authoring experience. This slide deck, [Understand KFP v2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HzMwtI2QN67xQp2lSxmuXhitEsukLB7mvZx4KAPub3A/edit#slide=id.gecbd775238_0_20),
 provides a good overview of v2. 

<br />

The KFP v2 alpha introduces: 

- An Argo-agnostic approach for creating and running pipelines 
- A brand new DAG visualization, which uses the Pipeline Template and MLMD in this [pipeline spec](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/api/v2alpha1/pipeline_spec.proto)
- [Streamlined Component Authoring](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HzMwtI2QN67xQp2lSxmuXhitEsukLB7mvZx4KAPub3A/edit#slide=id.gecbd775238_0_438)

<br />

You can learn more about KFP v2 and the related breaking changes in these docs:

- [KFP SDK V2 CLI design](ahttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z79ebKaf3hjyadSRsme1Qo7F-Tqu4qM1cyKuLeu2PgA/edit)
- [The SDK reference](https://kubeflow-pipelines.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
- [Breaking changes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nCUUVRXexXbQ0LDkGHsMIBDSu1WvJA9Upy1JzybNVMk/edit) including an SDK change from `kfp.v2` to `kfp` 

<br />

For those users who are still relying on the KFP v1 functionality, Kubeflow v1.6 and its KFP v2 component are fully
 tested and supported with the mature features in the legacy Kubeflow Pipelines v1.8 SDK. This provides the same
 functionality that thousands of KFP v1 users leverage in production today.   

<br />

In addition to the KFP v2 alpha, Kubeflow 1.6 includes feature enhancements and operational improvements for Katib
 users. These include support for:

- The population based training algorithm
- Enhanced validation checks for configurations, which will save time debugging parameter misconfiguration
- Security fixes
- MetricsUnavailable Status support, which will make debugging easier

<br />

In Kubeflow v1.6, the Training Operator Working Group added these valuable enhancements:

- Python SDK for PyTorch, MXNet, MPI, XGBoost  
- The Clientset (Golang) is also generated for PyTorch, MXNet, MPI, XGBoost   
- Gang scheduling support for MPI

<br />

Kubeflow v1.6 has several functional and operational improvements to Kubeflow Notebooks, Central Dashboard, webapps and
 controllers. The following highlights the closed PRs that were considered medium-sized or larger. You can review
 the full list of the closed PRs [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).

- [Support for K8s 1.22](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/6353)
- [PodDefaults webhook picking up new certificates](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/5560) 
- Show objects from all names spaces in Central Dashboard, Jupyter, Tensorboard, Volumes Mgr
- Updated the hosting container registry of images
- [CVE fixes for Central Dashboard](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6519)  

<br />

The Manifest Working Group contributed several enhancements in 1.6. These enhancements including the testing of each
 Kubeflow’s component manifest for:

<br />

For model serving, Kubeflow v1.6 incorporates the KServe v0.8.0 release, which includes these enhancements:

- ClusterServingRuntime and ServingRuntime CRDs 
- A new Model Spec is introduced to the InferenceService Predictor Spec as a new way to specify models.
- Support for Knative 1.0+ 
- gRPC for transformer to predictor network communication
- Multi-namespace support for the ModelMesh alternative backend

<br />

KServe has these breaking changes to the Python SDK:

- KFModel is renamed to Model
- KFServer is renamed to ModelServer
- KFModelRepository is renamed to ModelRepository
